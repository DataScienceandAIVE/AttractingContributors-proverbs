# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

# Proverbs
It is good to be reminded by simple saying or PROVERBS that we wish someone say to us. So why not put it here and let other see and wish it is going to have a good impact to our life journey.
So let us go :
